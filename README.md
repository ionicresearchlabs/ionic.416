## HOW IT WORKS

IONIC.416 is a collection of automated [client-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side) web components that gather, process and display real-time, near-real-time and historical public data feeds generated within and about the metropolitan area of Toronto, Canada.

The longer IONIC.416 is kept open and running, the more information it acquires. Textual data is stored in the browser's [built-in database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_Database_API) for easy retrieval, searching, sorting, analysis, visualization and so on.

None of the standard IONIC.416 components require any special server installation, server-side scripts or additional software. Everything is included and it all works collaboratively in the browser, as nature intended.
